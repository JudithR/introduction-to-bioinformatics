# Welcome to "Introduction to Bioinformatics"

## Bioinformatics

The field of bioinformatics deals with research, development and application
of computational tools and approaches for expanding the use of molecular, 
biological, medical, behavorial or health data.  It is also concerned with means to
acquire, store, organize, archive, analyze or visualize such data. 
Bioinformatics is an interdisciplinary field at the intersection of, among
others, biology, computer science and statistics.

The first activities in bioinformatics trace back to the 1950s, when
researchers such as Frederick Sanger started to experimentally elucidate the
sequences of proteins and - later - DNA.  Margaret Dayhoff was among the
first to develop algorithms to analyse such sequences
{cite}`dayhoff_comprotein_1962`.  The term "bioinformatics" was subsequently coined
by Paulien Hogeweg and Ben Hesper in 1970
{cite}`hesper_bioinformatics_2021`, to describe "the study of informatic
processes in biotic systems", and gradually became used to denote the entire
field.

Research in bioinformatics really took off in the 1990s, with the
introduction and wide-spread use of -omics technologies (DNA sequencing,
gene expression microarrays, mass spectrometry for proteins and metabolites,
etc.) and the Human Genome Project.  Much of the resulting data, as well as
the knowledge gained in these experiments, was made freely available for
researchers in the form of computer databases.  The processing and analysis
of these large volumes of data on molecules and their interactions required
dedicated algorithms and sofware to be developed.  Bioinformatics thus
further developed into a thriving research area in its own right, providing
the computational methods that are by now essential for most biological
research.  Computational biologists these days even address complex
biological and evolutionary questions without going into the lab, by
integrating and interrogating existing data in novel ways.

## Teaching bioinformatics

Bioinformatics can be taught at a wide range of levels, from high school
biology students to BSc students in biological or biotechnological
programmes and even MSc or PhD students in bioinformatics.  While
researchers in bioinformatics or computational biology will need to develop
a sound basis in statistics, programming and data analysis/machine learning,
a far broader range of life scientists - the target audience of this book -
will make use of bioinformatics methods as part of their everyday work or
research, and mostly require practical knowledge. For these students,
detailed understanding of the underlying mathematics and computer science is
less relevant; they should however realise what main methods and databases
are available, what their specific uses and limitations are, and how they should
interpret the outcomes of computational analyses.  

To support life science students to reach these learning goals, we developed
a BSc course "Introduction to Bioinformatics" at Wageningen University .  We
structured it around the "journey" a researcher would take to study an unknown
sequence:

## Why a new book?

Bioinformatics is a fast moving field with a constant stream of new
techniques, tools and relevant biological insights.  While a number of
undergraduate text books on the topic are available, they generally struggle
to keep up with this high rate of change.  As teachers of a BSc-level
introductory course on bioinformatics, we struggled each year to collect a
relevant set of reading material on the topics we intend to cover.  Where
one book might fit one week, the chapters relevant to another week might
have been outdated, forcing us to use different books.  In addition, the
level of detail in the books did not always correspond with the level of
understanding we aim to achieve in students.

We therefore decided to bundle current knowledge and our expertise in the
form of a reader, tailored to the level that we aim to achieve in our BSc course. 
The five steps along the journey above are reflected in a setup with five
chapters, that each contain basic text, various boxes with different types
of material (see below), practical exercises and references:

```{tableofcontents}

```

After some years of development and streamlining, we have now reached the stage 
that we feel it is ready to release it to the community as an online textbook, free
for use. We hope you find it useful!

Be aware that the practical exercises mostly rely on online databases and tools, that
can be inacessible at times and regularly change their layout, operation or use
policies; each fall, we revisit these exercises to ensure they work for our
class, but at other times you may run into issues. 

As with any textbook, this first release will likely
contain errors, omissions etc.; if you do find any, please contact us at
[introduction\@bioinformatics.nl](mailto:introduction\@bioinformatics.nl).
We are investigating ways to support the online incorporation of reader
feedback or even extensions to the reader. We have done our best to ensure
that all material (figures etc.) is only re-used when copyright allows it,
but if you still find some material that you believe is incorrectly used or
cited, please let us know.

## Reading guide

The text is decorated with different types of boxes that show additional
information or are used to highlight and clarify important aspects.  Yellow
and blue boxes are part of the exam material for this course, green boxes
provide useful additional information or links.

```{admonition} Important information
:class: important
A yellow box indicates important information that you should remember and is definitely part of the exam material.
```

```{admonition} Note 1: Noteworthy information
:class: note
Highlighted information that is considered part of the exam material. Notes are numbered for easy reference.
```

```{admonition} Box 1: Additional information
:class: tip
Additional information, often times provides extra examples to material mentioned in the main text. Not part of the exam material, but might make exam material more clear. Boxes are numbered for easy reference.
```

```{admonition} See also
:class: seealso
Link to external information, like videos or blogs. Not exam material, but might make exam material more clear.
