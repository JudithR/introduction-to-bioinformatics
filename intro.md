## Bioinformatics

The field of Bioinformatics deals with research, development, or application of tools and
approaches for expanding the use of biological, medical, behavorial or health
data. It also includes all aspects necessary to acquire, store, organize, archive, analyze or visualize such data.

The term Bioinformatics was coined by Paulien Hogeweg in 1970 to describe "the study of informatic processes in biotic systems".

Bioinformatics is an interdisciplinary field, on the intersection of, among others, biology, computer science and statistics.

## The reader

### Why a reader?

Bioinformatics is a fast moving field with a constant stream of new techniques, tools and relevant biological insights. Classical text books struggle to keep up with this high rate of change. We as teachers have consequently struggled each year to collect a relevant set of reading materials. Where one book might have fit one week, the chapters relevant to another week might have been outdated, forcing us to use different books. In addition, the level of detail in the books does not always correspond with what we want you to learn, forcing us to explain which paragraphs you need to know and which not.

To make it easier both for us, as teachers, and for you, as students, we have decided to bundle current knowledge and our expertise in this reader and to tailor it to the level of this course. As it is online, it is easy to update and maintain.

This reader is a work in progress. Please let us know if you find any mistakes, missing material, etc.

We hope that you find it useful!

### How to use the reader

The Reader is devided into chapters that each cover a different week of the course. All information provided in the Reader is considered exam material, unless it clearly states otherwise.
