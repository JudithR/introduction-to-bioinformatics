	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Sequence similarity searching is a very important bioinformatics task. While Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) outperforms exact methods through its use of heuristics, the speed of the current BLAST software is suboptimal for very long queries or database sequences. There are also some shortcomings in the user-interface of the current command-line applications. RESULTS: We describe features and improvements of rewritten BLAST software and introduce new command-line applications. Long query sequences are broken into chunks for processing, in some cases leading to dramatically shorter run times. For long database sequences, it is possible to retrieve only the relevant parts of the sequence, reducing CPU time and memory usage for searches of short queries against databases of contigs or chromosomes. The program can now retrieve masking information for database sequences from the BLAST databases. A new modular software library can now access subject sequence data from arbitrary data sources. We introduce several new features, including strategy files that allow a user to save and reuse their favorite set of options. The strategy files can be uploaded to and downloaded from the NCBI BLAST web site. CONCLUSION: The new BLAST command-line applications, compared to the current BLAST tools, demonstrate substantial speed improvements for long queries as well as chromosome length database sequences. We have also improved the user interface of the command-line applications.},

	abstract = "{Until recently, it has been common practice for a phylogenetic analysis to use a single gene sequence from a single individual organism as a proxy for an entire species. With technological advances, it is now becoming more common to collect data sets containing multiple gene loci and multiple individuals per species. These data sets often reveal the need to directly model intraspecies polymorphism and incomplete lineage sorting in phylogenetic estimation procedures.For a single species, coalescent theory is widely used in contemporary population genetics to model intraspecific gene trees. Here, we present a Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo method for the multispecies coalescent. Our method coestimates multiple gene trees embedded in a shared species tree along with the effective population size of both extant and ancestral species. The inference is made possible by multilocus data from multiple individuals per species.Using a multiindividual data set and a series of simulations of rapid species radiations, we demonstrate the efficacy of our new method. These simulations give some insight into the behavior of the method as a function of sampled individuals, sampled loci, and sequence length. Finally, we compare our new method to both an existing method (BEST 2.2) with similar goals and the supermatrix (concatenation) method. We demonstrate that both BEST and our method have much better estimation accuracy for species tree topology than concatenation, and our method outperforms BEST in divergence time and population size estimation.}",

Here, we describe new additions that make MEGA a more comprehensive tool for building timetrees of species, pathogens, and gene families using rapid relaxed-clock methods. Methods for estimating divergence times and confidence intervals are implemented to use probability densities for calibration constraints for node-dating and sequence sampling dates for tip-dating analyses. They are supported by new options for tagging sequences with spatiotemporal sampling information, an expanded interactive Node Calibrations Editor, and an extended Tree Explorer to display timetrees. Also added is a Bayesian method for estimating neutral evolutionary probabilities of alleles in a species using multispecies sequence alignments and a machine learning method to test for the autocorrelation of evolutionary rates in phylogenies. The computer memory requirements for the maximum likelihood analysis are reduced significantly through reprogramming, and the graphical user interface has been made more responsive and interactive for very big data sets. These enhancements will improve the user experience, quality of results, and the pace of biological discovery. Natively compiled graphical user interface and command-line versions of MEGA11 are available for Microsoft Windows, Linux, and macOS from www.megasoftware.net.}",

Here, we present NetSurfP-3.0, a tool for predicting solvent accessibility, secondary structure, structural disorder and backbone dihedral angles for each residue of an amino acid sequence. This NetSurfP update exploits recent advances in pre-trained protein language models to drastically improve the runtime of its predecessor by two orders of magnitude, while displaying similar prediction performance. We assessed the accuracy of NetSurfP-3.0 on several independent test datasets and found it to consistently produce state-of-the-art predictions for each of its output features, with a runtime that is up to to 600 times faster than the most commonly available methods performing the same tasks. The tool is freely available as a web server with a user-friendly interface to navigate the results, as well as a standalone downloadable package.}",

	abstract={Proteins are essential to life, and understanding their structure can facilitate a mechanistic understanding of their function. Through an enormous experimental effort1--4, the structures of around 100,000 unique proteins have been determined5, but this represents a small fraction of the billions of known protein sequences6,7. Structural coverage is bottlenecked by the months to years of painstaking effort required to determine a single protein structure. Accurate computational approaches are needed to address this gap and to enable large-scale structural bioinformatics. Predicting the three-dimensional structure that a protein will adopt based solely on its amino acid sequence---the structure prediction component of the `protein folding problem'8---has been an important open research problem for more than 50 years9. Despite recent progress10--14, existing methods fall far short of atomic accuracy, especially when no homologous structure is available. Here we provide the first computational method that can regularly predict protein structures with atomic accuracy even in cases in which no similar structure is known. We validated an entirely redesigned version of our neural network-based model, AlphaFold, in the challenging 14th Critical Assessment of protein Structure Prediction (CASP14)15, demonstrating accuracy competitive with experimental structures in a majority of cases and greatly outperforming other methods. Underpinning the latest version of AlphaFold is a novel machine learning approach that incorporates physical and biological knowledge about protein structure, leveraging multi-sequence alignments, into the design of the deep learning algorithm.},

	abstract = {The introduction of AlphaFold 2 has spurred a revolution in modelling the structure of proteins and their interactions, enabling a huge range of applications in protein modelling and design. In this paper, we describe our AlphaFold 3 model with a substantially updated diffusion-based architecture, which is capable of joint structure prediction of complexes including proteins, nucleic acids, small molecules, ions, and modified residues. The new AlphaFold model demonstrates significantly improved accuracy over many previous specialised tools: far greater accuracy on protein-ligand interactions than state of the art docking tools, much higher accuracy on protein-nucleic acid interactions than nucleic-acid-specific predictors, and significantly higher antibody-antigen prediction accuracy than AlphaFold-Multimer v2.3. Together these results show that high accuracy modelling across biomolecular space is possible within a single unified deep learning framework.},

	abstract = {Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar Stanley (S. Stanley) is a pathogen that contaminates food, and is related to Salmonella outbreaks in a variety of hosts such as humans and farm animals through products like dairy items and vegetables. Despite the fact that several vaccines of Salmonella strains had been constructed, none of them were developed according to serovar Stanley up to this day. This study presents results of genome sequencing and analysis on our S. Stanley UPM 517 strain taken from fecal swabs of 21-day-old healthy commercial chickens in Perak, Malaysia and used Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar Typhimurium LT2 (S. Typhimurium LT2) as a reference to be compared with. First, sequencing and assembling of the Salmonella Stanley UPM 517 genome into a contiguous form were done. The work was then continued with scaffolding and gap filling. Annotation and alignment of the draft genome was performed with S. Typhimurium LT2. The other elements of virulence estimated in this study included Salmonella pathogenicity islands, resistance genes, prophages, virulence factors, plasmid regions, restriction-modification sites and the CRISPR-Cas system. The S. Stanley UPM 517 draft genome had a length of 4,736,817 bp with 4,730 coding sequence and 58 RNAs. It was discovered via genomic analysis on this strain that there were antimicrobial resistance properties toward a wide variety of antibiotics. Tcf and ste, the two fimbrial virulence clusters related with human and broiler intestinal colonizations which were not found in S. Typhimurium LT2, were atypically discovered in the S. Stanley UPM 517 genome. These clusters are involved in the intestinal colonization of human and broilers, respectively. There were seven Salmonella pathogenicity islands (SPIs) within the draft genome, which contained the virulence factors associated with Salmonella infection (except SPI-14). Five intact prophage regions, mostly comprising of the protein encoding Gifsy-1, Fels-1, RE-2010 and SEN34 prophages, were also encoded in the draft genome. Also identified were Type I–III restriction-modification sites and the CRISPR-Cas system of the Type I–E subtype. As this strain exhibited resistance toward numerous antibiotics, we distinguished several genes that had the potential for removal in the construction of a possible vaccine candidate to restrain and lessen the pervasiveness of salmonellosis and to function as an alternative to antibiotics.},

Individuals harboring BRCA mutations are at a higher risk of developing breast and/or ovarian cancers. This risk is much greater in the presence of germline mutations. BRCA1 and BRCA2 play crucial role in the DNA damage response and repair pathway, a function that is critical in preserving the integrity of the genome. Mutations that interfere with normal cellular function of BRCA not only lead to onset and progression of cancer but also modulate therapy outcome of treatment with platinum drugs. In this review, we discuss the structural and functional impact of some of the prevalent BRCA mutations in breast and ovarian cancers and their role in platinum therapy response. Understanding the response of platinum drugs in the context of BRCA mutations may contribute toward developing better therapeutics that can improve survival and quality of life of patients.}

Here we focus on the polymorphism of male mating strategies in the ruff (Calidris pugnax, Aves Charadriiformes). In ruffs, three fixed alternative male mating strategies coexist and are signaled by extreme plumage polymorphism. We first present relevant data on the biology of the species. Then we review the available knowledge of the behavioral ecology of ruffs during the breeding season, and we detail the characteristics of each of the three known fixed male mating strategies. We next turn to the results of exceptional quality accumulated on both the structural and functional genomics of the ruff over the past few years. We show how much these genomic data can shed new, mechanistic light on the evolution and maintenance of the three fixed alternative male mating strategies. We then look if there is sufficient indication to support frequency-dependent selection as a key mechanism in maintaining these three strategies. Specifically, we search for evidence of equal fitness among individuals using each of the three strategies. Finally, we propose three lines of research avenues that will help to understand the eco-evolutionary dynamics of phenotypic differences within natural populations of this iconic model species.},

	abstract = {Cellular senescence is a crucial tumor suppressor mechanism. We discovered a CAPERα/TBX3 repressor complex required to prevent senescence in primary cells and mouse embryos. Critical, previously unknown roles for CAPERα in controlling cell proliferation are manifest in an obligatory interaction with TBX3 to regulate chromatin structure and repress transcription of \textit{CDKN2A-p16}\textsuperscript{\textit{INK}} and the RB pathway. The IncRNA \textit{UCA1} is a direct target of CAPERα/TBX3 repression whose overexpression is sufficient to induce senescence. In proliferating cells, we found that hnRNPA1 binds and destabilizes \textit{CDKN2A-p16}\textsuperscript{\textit{INK}} mRNA whereas during senescence, \textit{UCA1} sequesters hnRNPA1 and thus stabilizes \textit{CDKN2A-p16}\textsuperscript{\textit{INK}}. Thus CAPERα/TBX3 and \textit{UCA1} constitute a coordinated, reinforcing mechanism to regulate both \textit{CDKN2A-p16}\textsuperscript{\textit{INK}} transcription and mRNA stability. Dissociation of the CAPERα/TBX3 co-repressor during oncogenic stress activates \textit{UCA1}, revealing a novel mechanism for oncogene-induced senescence. Our elucidation of CAPERα and \textit{UCA1} functions in vivo provides new insights into senescence induction, and the oncogenic and developmental properties of TBX3.},

Making sense of DNA replication origins is important for improving our capacity to study cellular processes and functions in the regulation of gene expression, genome integrity in much finer detail. Thus, clearly comprehending the positions and sequences of replication origins which are fundamental to chromosome organization and duplication is the first priority of all. In view of such important roles of replication origins, tremendous work has been aimed at identifying and testing the specificity of replication origins. A number of computational tools based on various skew types have been developed to predict replication origins. Using various <italic>in silico</italic> approaches such as Ori-Finder, and databases such as DoriC, researchers have predicted the locations of replication origins sites for thousands of bacterial chromosomes and archaeal genomes. Based on the predicted results, we should choose an effective method for identifying and confirming the interactions at origins of replication. Here we describe the main existing experimental methods that aimed to determine the replication origin regions and list some of the many the practical applications of these methods.}

Proteomics has been used to investigate a few B. melitensis and B. abortus strains, but data for other species and biovars are limited. Hence, a comprehensive analysis of proteomes will significantly contribute to understanding the enigmatic biology of brucellae. For direct identification and typing of Brucella, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization—time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI—TOF MS) has become a reliable tool for routine diagnosis due to its ease of handling, price and sensitivity highlighting the potential of proteome-based techniques. Proteome analysis will also help to overcome the historic but still notorious Brucella obstacles of infection medicine, the lack of safe and protective vaccines and sensitive serologic diagnostic tools by identifying the most efficient protein antigens. This perspective summarizes past and recent developments in Brucella proteomics with a focus on species identification and serodiagnosis. Future applications of proteomics in these fields are discussed.},

	abstract={The shotgun proteomics strategy, based on digesting proteins into peptides and sequencing them using tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS), has become widely adopted. The identification of peptides from acquired MS/MS spectra is most often performed using the database search approach. We provide a detailed description of the peptide identification process and review the most commonly used database search programs. The appropriate choice of the search parameters and the sequence database are important for successful application of this method, and we provide general guidelines for carrying out efficient analysis of MS/MS data. We also discuss various reasons why database search tools fail to assign the correct sequence to many MS/MS spectra, and draw attention to the problem of false-positive identifications that can significantly diminish the value of published data. To assist in the evaluation of peptide assignments to MS/MS spectra, we review the scoring schemes implemented in most frequently used database search tools. We also describe statistical approaches and computational tools for validating peptide assignments to MS/MS spectra, including the concept of expectation values, reversed database searching, and the empirical Bayesian analysis of PeptideProphet. Finally, the process of inferring the identities of the sample proteins given the list of peptide identifications is outlined, and the limitations of shotgun proteomics with regard to discrimination between protein isoforms are discussed.},

	abstract = {Streptococcus parauberis is an important bacterial fish pathogen that causes streptococcosis in a variety of fish species including the olive flounder. Despite its importance in the aquaculture industry, little is known about the survival strategy of S. parauberis in the host. Therefore, the objective of this study was to produce genome-wide transcriptome data and identify key factors for the survival of S. parauberis SPOF3K in its host. To this end, S. parauberis SPOF3K was incubated in olive flounder serum and nutrient-enriched media as a control. Although S. parauberis SPOF3K proliferated in both culture conditions, the transcriptomic patterns of the two groups were very different. Interestingly, the expression levels of genes responsible for the replication of an S. parauberis plasmid in the presence of olive flounder serum were higher than those in the absence of olive flounder serum, indicating that this plasmid may play an important role in the survival and proliferation of S. parauberis in the host. Several ATP-binding cassette transporters known to transport organic substrates (e.g., biotin and osmoprotectants) that are vital for bacterial survival in the host were significantly up-regulated in S. parauberis cultured in serum. In addition, groEL, dnaK operon, and members of the clp protease family, which are known to play important roles in response to various stressors, were up-regulated in S. parauberis incubated in serum, thus limiting damage and facilitating cellular recovery. Moreover, important virulence factors including the hyaluronic acid capsule (has operon), sortase A (srtA), C5a peptidase (scp), and peptidoglycan O-acetyltransferase (oatA) were significantly upregulated in S. paraubers in serum. These results indicate that S. paraubers can resist and evade the humoral immune responses of fish. The transcriptomic data obtained in this study provide a better understanding of the mode of action of S. parauberis in fish.},

We show that TCR loci rearrange in a highly ordered way (TCRD-TCRG-TCRB-TCRA) and that the initiating Dδ2-Dδ3 rearrangement occurs at the most immature CD34+CD38−CD1a− stage. TCRB rearrangement starts at the CD34+CD38+CD1a− stage and complete in-frame TCRB rearrangements were first detected in the immature single positive stage. TCRB rearrangement data together with the PTCRA (pTα) expression pattern show that human TCRβ-selection occurs at the CD34+CD38+CD1a+ stage. By combining the TCR rearrangement data with gene expression data, we identified candidate factors for the initiation/regulation of TCR recombination. Our data demonstrate that a number of key events occur earlier than assumed previously; therefore, human T cell development is much more similar to murine T cell development than reported before. }",

EasyGO is valuable for its proficiency, and has proved useful in uncovering biological knowledge in massive data sets from high-throughput experiments. For agriGO, the system architecture and website interface were redesigned to improve performance and accessibility. The supported organisms and gene identifiers were substantially expanded (including 38 agricultural species composed of 274 data types). The requirement on user input is more flexible, in that user-defined reference and annotation are accepted. Moreover, a new analysis approach using Gene Set Enrichment Analysis strategy and customizable features is provided. Four tools, SEA (Singular enrichment analysis), PAGE (Parametric Analysis of Gene set Enrichment), BLAST4ID (Transfer IDs by BLAST) and SEACOMPARE (Cross comparison of SEA), are integrated as a toolkit to meet different demands. We also provide a cross-comparison service so that different data sets can be compared and explored in a visualized way.

This is especially true for topics covering computational tools and data science, as both are challenging to incorporate in the standard curriculum. These atypical learning environments offer new opportunities for teaching, particularly when it comes to combining conceptual knowledge with hands-on experience/expertise with methods and skills. Advances in cloud computing and containerized environments provide an attractive opportunity to improve the effciency and ease with which students can learn. This manuscript details recent advances towards using commonly-Available cloud computing services and advanced cyberinfrastructure support for improving the learning experience in bootcamp-style events. We cover the benets (and challenges) of using a server hosted remotely instead of relying on student laptops, discuss the technology that was used in order to make this possible, and give suggestions for how others could implement and improve upon this model for pedagogy and reproducibility.},

Cognitive neuroscience has seen rapid growth in the size and complexity of data recorded from the human brain as well as in the computational tools available to analyze this data. This data explosion has resulted in an increased use of multivariate, model-based methods for asking neuroscience questions, allowing scientists to investigate multiple hypotheses with a single dataset, to use complex, time-varying stimuli, and to study the human brain under more naturalistic conditions. These tools come in the form of “Encoding” models, in which stimulus features are used to model brain activity, and “Decoding” models, in which neural features are used to generated a stimulus output. Here we review the current state of encoding and decoding models in cognitive electrophysiology and provide a practical guide toward conducting experiments and analyses in this emerging field. Our examples focus on using linear models in the study of human language and audition. We show how to calculate auditory receptive fields from natural sounds as well as how to decode neural recordings to predict speech. The paper aims to be a useful tutorial to these approaches, and a practical introduction to using machine learning and applied statistics to build models of neural activity. The data analytic approaches we discuss may also be applied to other sensory modalities, motor systems, and cognitive systems, and we cover some examples in these areas. In addition, a collection of Jupyter notebooks is publicly available as a complement to the material covered in this paper, providing code examples and tutorials for predictive modeling in python. The aimis to provide a practical understanding of predictivemodeling of human brain data and to propose best-practices in conducting these analyses.},
